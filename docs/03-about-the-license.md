## GPL

As documented in https://github.com/loufranco/DocOMatKit/LICENSE.md

The GPL is incompatible with App Store or Enterprise distribution, but this
license can be used for personal projects, learning, or demoing the software.

## Limited non-commercial App Store license

NOTE: This license is not available yet, but is here for discussion purposes. If you would
like to apply this license to a project, contact Lou Franco.

This license only applies to the repository at https://github.com/loufranco/DocOMatKit.
If you are reading this on a fork, this license does not transfer.

All of the liability clauses of the GPL apply. This license is meant to 
relax your responsibilities as a developer using this code.

If all of these apply:

1. The app source must be published with a GPL license. You may have additional licenses, 
   but you must make clear that they don't apply to Doc-o-Mat Kit.
1. The app must be available in the App Store for free.  Other versions of the app (e.g. an 
   enterprise one) do not inherit this license.
1. The app must not have any in-app-purchases except for donations
   as described below.
1. The app must use DocOMatKit as a dynamic framework.
1. The app must not host or show advertising.
1. All of the documentation that Doc-o-Mat Kit is presenting must
   be freely available on the web.
1. All of the documenation that Doc-o-Mat Kit is presenting must
   be shown in the app without requiring an account or login.
1. The app may solicit donations for the organization that owns
   the App Store account that is distributing the app.
1. The app may solicit donations for any 501(c)3 organization.
1. The README or equivalent must credit Doc-o-Mat Kit and link to its canonical repository.
1. Your repository must contain a file that outlines your compliance to this license with links
   to the AppStore, the web version of the documentation you are presenting, your own GPL license
   in the repository.  If you are soliticiting donations, you must provide a link to the organization.

Then, you may use DocOMatKit code in an AppStore app, and you are not required to provide a way for
end-users to update the embedded DocOMatKit binaries from source.
